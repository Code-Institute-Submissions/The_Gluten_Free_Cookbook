            Welcome to The Gluten Free Cookbook! Our online community dedicated to food lovers that prefer or are
            restricted to a gluten free diet.
            Almost 3 years ago, my husband had to be put on a gluten free diet. We were heartbroken, we love food and
            love cooking food. We felt restricted to
            what we were able to make and eat. But, we then discovered that being on a gluten free diet should not
            restrict us, but forces us to be more creative
            on the food choices we make. So, welcome to this online community. We want to share and discover recipes
            from backgrounds that are gluten free.
            Let's Get Cooking!
